Note that passing the deadline by 1 minute or 23 hours are both counted as one grace day. Instructor-granted extensions are only considered after all grace days are used and can only be given in exceptional situations. Late homework submitted when you have run out of grace days leads to a reduction of 20% from the total points for that assignment. For instance, if in homework 1 you submit 2 days late and in homework 2 you submit 1 day late, then you do not get penalty for these two submissions, but you have used all your 3 grace days now. For homework 3, if you submit 1 day late (e.g. submit 2 minutes late than the deadline), you will get a penalty of 20% of the total points for homework 3; same penalty applies to all subsequent homeworks. HARD deadline of 3 days past the original due date. Late submissions after the hard deadline (penalty or not) lead to ZERO point (unless in very special cases and under the approval of the instructor. For instance, if you submit homework 2 in the 3rd day after deadline and you used no grace day before, then you get no penalty since it is still within 3 grace days; but if you submit in the 4th day, you will get ZERO point since it passes the HARD deadline.

When the unexpected happens – you get the flu, the network goes down, you delete a critical file, a personal situation escalates – you would usually have to request an extension from the staff. Instead, you are given the privilege to grant yourself an extension without our oversight. One grace day extends the deadline by 24 hours. Grace days are your means to cover real problems: illness, stolen laptops, bike accidents, and so on. We don’t intend for them to cover ski trips, overcommitment, or poor planning, but you can use them as you choose and we don’t check up on you. You may use all of your grace days for one assignment, distribute them across several assignments, or even better, hoard them for a crisis that thankfully never comes.
